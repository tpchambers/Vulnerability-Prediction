## Source Code
Instruction on how to run developed scripts. For simplicity, we will first specify the steps neccesarry to run the evaluations on testing data on trained models. Next, we provide instructions on how to run the (1) source embedding scripts to create 5 disjoint under-sampled datasets in their embedded representation and (2) scripts that creates binary classifiers and trains on data. 

Instructions:
1. Download Google Drive Folder containing scrips and datasets. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C3zO1cC6vPRxarz8KyuS00cOOIKK1EpX?usp=sharing)
2. Copy the entire folder to your Google Drive in the following path: "/content/gdrive/MyDrive"

### How To Run Source Code Embedding Scripts


### How To Run Scripts That Builds ML Models and Trains on Processed Dataset


Scripts:

1. Source Code Embedding.ipynb  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TaPTvzdkj1RCGDG4tn6K6i-T8Yv8duwr?usp=sharing - This script is utilized to generate source code embeddings, undersample the dataset and create 5 different datasets per vulnerability category.
2. CNN.ipynb https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bp0u_lSbEkLXs0GNQ5GPc6evGP6PcIiC/view?usp=sharing - This script builds and trains a CNN model on the 5 CWE datasets
3. MLP.ipynb https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqAlpuCJNiayK0anym_yvIhERAe-dUTF/view?usp=sharing This script builds and trains a MLP model on the 5 CWE datasets
4. SVM_LTSM.ipynb https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ryl10Kedm9exsEKULQPLgdzXc-kjU-Hg This script builds and trains an SVM model (and LTSM model) on the 5 CWE datasets. Simply download the datasets cleaned from the google drive folder entitled "Processed Datasets", and copy them into this colab folder which will run the models. Name the files "cwe_119_train.csv", 'cwe_120_train.csv','cwe_469_train.csv', 'cwe_476_train.csv' , and 'cwe_other_train.csv' prior to compiling.
